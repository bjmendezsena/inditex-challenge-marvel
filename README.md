## Architecture ‚öôÔ∏è

The chosen architecture is
**[bullet proof react.](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)**

It gives us the possibility of decoupling the different layers of the
application and encapsulating both the logic and the UI of each module,
facilitating scalability.

## Project structure üóÑÔ∏è

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- app               # contain all pages and manage all the application routes based on file names.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
    |
    +-- module        # Contains everything related to the module, encapsulating both the UI and the logic of the module itself.
        |
        +-- api           # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
        |
        +-- components    # components scoped to a specific feature
        |
        +-- types         # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
        |
        +-- index.ts      # entry point for the feature, it serves as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all of the application providers
|
+-- tests             # tests utilities and mock server
|
+-- types             # base types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```


**- Features folder**

In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, most
of the code is inside the `features` folder, which contains different
feature-based things. Every `feature` folder contains domain specific code for a
given feature. This allows to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not
mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a
flat folder structure with many files.

Everything from a feature is exported from the `index.ts` file which behaves as
the public API of the feature. The elements are imported from other functions
only using:

`import {FeatureComponent} from "@/features/module"`

and not

`import {FeatureComponent} from "@/features/module/components/FeatureComponent`
